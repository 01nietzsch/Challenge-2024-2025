    "In this exercise you will try to optimise a decision tree algorithm, and ensure that it is possible to output a metric. (<i>hint: use a `class`</i>)\n",
    "\n",
    "After this you will generate some data using the following function. The function is designed to be discontinuous, meaning that a regular linear regression model will fail to predict values accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will compare your own decision tree model to the `LinearRegression` class and the `RandomForestRegressor` class in `scikit-learn`. It will be important to plot your data so that someone else can instantly see which model gives the best performance."

    "1. Add the keyword argument `M`, where `M` is less than the total number for input variables\n",
    "2. Randomly create a subset of `M` input variables (i.e. column indices, e.g. if `M = 3`, `columns = [1, 4, 7]`)\n",
    "3. For each of the indices, calculate the variance `y`\n",
    "4. Use the column with the highest variance\n",
    "5. Add the keyword argument `P`, where `P` is the number of partitions to attempt\n",
    "6. Using the column with highest variance, create `P` partitions and calculate the average variance of the two resultant sections of data\n",
    "7. Use the partition with the lowest average variance\n",
    "8. Add the keyword argument `tolerance`, where `tolerance` is the minimum value for the variance before stopping\n",
