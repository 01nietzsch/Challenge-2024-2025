    "Up until this point we have used only manual preprocessing functions. Whilst this is acceptable and also useful for beginner programmers, it can be computationally inefficient, and manually coding many different encoding algorithms is usually not a good use of time, and also allows for preprocessing mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we introduce the users to a software package that will be used in the rest of the lectures, `scikit-learn`. This is a python package used for simple machine learning tasks, and it is designed to be highly optimised.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different processing functions that can be found in the `sklearn.preprocessing` module, the documentation for which can be found at this link: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The answers to this exercise will contain some examples of `sklearn.preprocessing` functions</b>, but it is important for users to to remember that coding simple functions like scalers and encoders has merits because it allows the user total control over the algorithms implemented. In the case of preprocessing, there is not a single <i>right way</i> of preprocessing the data, and hence we encourage users to only use `sklearn.preprocessing` functions when they fully understand the algorithms that have been implemented."
