    "\n",
    "In these notes, we will start to have a look at some general, initial steps we need to make to implement a Machine Learning approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard, the question you should probably ask yourself is the following: Why is it called \"Machine Learning\"? What exactly is it that we are trying to learn? One practical **definition of learning is the following: to extract a pattern from some data, so that this pattern can be used to make predictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the previous definition, it is clear that **to learn, we need some data as a source**.  \n",
    "The quality of what we learn depends necessarily on the quality of the data but also how the data is presented to the learner. Thus, the initial step for an ML pipeline concerns exactly this aspect: database preparation. We will cover the basics in these lectures but you can find additional info in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiKwYKmQzJc) and [document](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/preparing-and-curating-your-data-for-machine-learning?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=unpaidsocial&utm_campaign=mir-20191108-Prepare-Curate-Data) from Google for a more in-depth perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let us start with the simplest and somewhat trivial, initial task in the pipeline: learning how to read (and write) on a database."
