    "\n",
    "Datasets are not perfect, and often contain missing values. In this section, we will learn about potential procedures to handle these missing values. We do this to prevent their non-existence to be misrepresented in our pre-processed dataset, which could skew any subsequent result. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should understand, however, that some kind of bias will necessarily be introduced by these procedures. In practice, the only way to make sure no bias is introduced at all is to have a dataset that is as complete as possible: no amount of synthetic data or smart replacement procedure can truly make up for missing data, just reduce its effects!\n",

    "We first import our data by running the `pd.read_csv(name_of_file)` command, as seen in the cell below. Note that in order to be found, the file must be in the same directory/folder from where you are running your notebook. Alternatively, you should provide the [absolute path to the file](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/classic-sysadmin-absolute-path-vs-relative-path-in-linux-unix#:~:text=What%20Is%20An%20Absolute%20Path,of%20actual%20filesystem%20from%20%2F%20directory.).\n",

    "## Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "After dealing with missing values, the next step of the pre-processing pipeline is a procedure called **feature scaling**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand why scaling is important, you have to appreciate that many machine learning algorithms have been developed to calculate how much two objects \"differ\" from each other. In some way, we could say that we want to calculate some form of *distance* between these objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably very familiar with the typical distance calculated via Pitagora's rule in *N-D* (N-Dimensional) Euclidean space $d=\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2}$. This is just one possible definition of distance but [others can be used](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance). In general, when considering an N-dimensional space that might include heterogeneous data, for example, a height and weight, defining a useful distance requires different type of data to be scaled properly in relation to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us make an example: you might agree that the body of a person that is 1.80m and weighs 90kg is more similar to that of a person that measure 1.70 and weighs 80kg rather than a person that is 1.0m and weights 90kg. However, if you took a simple Euclidean distance using the pure (non-dimensional) values, this would not be the case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You might argue (and in some other context, rightly so!) that the problem is that we are comparing apples with oranges! Although you often hear this is something one should never do, we actually do it all the time when we classify objects. In fact, we do that by collecting data regarding size, shape, colour, smell and many other heterogeneous characteristics, which we blend together to create a definition of distance that we use to tell apart different objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "When many various objects are \"close\" together (according to our definition of distance) and separated from other groups - in jargon, they \"form a cluster\" - we often say they are similar and we give them a specific name. **This is what classification means in operative terms.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because classification is an important task, we would like our algorithms to be able to do it reliably and efficiently. As this requires often using different types of data, which we have seen in the previous example might lead to strange effects, *feature scaling* enters the game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how this works by using the previous example again. If instead of comparing the absolute values of the height and the weight, we would have used their value divided by that of an average person, we would have probably reached a more agreeable conclusion on who is more similar to who, even using a simple Euclidean distance. This \"division\" is nothing but one possible type of *feature scaling*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we introduce the different typical forms of feature scaling, it is important to highlight that this procedure is important for both classification and regression, not just the former.\n",

    "There is one more caveat to mention before wrapping up this section. Both of these scalers are affected by outliers. There are a variety of different scaling techniques and we have only presented two which are both very simple, but fall short in cases when the data has outliers which can skew the mean. In future lectures, we will introduce the use of more sophisticated pre-built scalers when we will introduce the `sci-kit learn` Python library, a package specifically devised for Machine Learning."

Whilst the steps have been conducted in order on the Iris dataset, we have not created a final dataset that would be ready to use. This has been left as an exercise. In reality, a user would construct a data pipeline that would consist of a single function that would wrap around all of these methods to streamline and improve the easy-of-use of these functionalities."
