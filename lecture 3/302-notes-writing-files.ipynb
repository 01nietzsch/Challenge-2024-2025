    "\n",
    "Whereas for reading we used `pd.read_csv(...)` to read a CSV file into a table, for writing a table to the same file type we will use a method of the `pd.DataFrame` class, and it is called `pd.DataFrame.to_csv(...)`\n",

    "JSON files are very useful for the portability of non-tabular data structures.  \n",

Advanced database technologies (e.g. mongoDB) and static high-memory file formats (e.g. HDF5) use the JavaScript Object format (although the data is stored as binary data rather than text) to manage complex data structures. The added bonus of using JSON-type files is that tabular data can easily by stored within them (although writing this to file is not trivial).\n",
